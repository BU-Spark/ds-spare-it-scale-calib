    "> **Overview:** This detailed comparative analysis aims to meticulously examine the differences between manual weight measurements conducted by students and the measurements obtained from scales, as recorded in our dataset. The objective is to identify and analyze any notable discrepancies between these two methods. Additionally, this analysis will explore the potential causes of these variances, providing insights into the reliability and accuracy of manual versus scale measurements. This investigation is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of manual weight estimation techniques and the precision of scale measurements, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of data collection methods in weight measurement studies."
